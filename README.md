# Detecting-Sleep-Apnea
I manufactured a test that uses a pneumography transducer and an application that identifies the different time segments when the person holds his breath, also detecting the maximum time he didnâ€™t breath and which segment it was- can help revealing pathologies that disturb the normal air flow from lungs such sudden infant death syndrome that happens from unproper air circulations. The moto of the MATLAB code I wrote was by detecting when the breathing rate is between -0.05mv to 0.05mv and its derivative is as between -0.02 to 0.02. With every apnea segment detected it marked the original graph with red. From these results, I calculated the time of each apnea segment and could tell the maximum time of apnea and to which segment is, how many apnea segments are there. 
Infantapnea file is the function of the application that marks the segemnts where the human stops breathing on the respitary rate in function of time graph, finds the time of each apnea segment, and finds the max time the the person/infant doesnt breath and the number of segment, also tells how many segemnts are there and the time of each of them.
Holdbreathing  is the Proof that the application works tested on 5 different data of holding breaths- you would get the max time the subject didnt breath, number of segment, and plotting of the data and marked segments
